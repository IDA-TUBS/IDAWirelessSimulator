# IDAWirelessSimulator

IDA Wireless Simulator is an open source library for the simulation of wireless networks, such as used for V2X communication. The library is designed to run within the OMNeT++ simulation engine. The IDA Wireless Simulator is developed by the Institute for Computer and Network Engineering (IDA) at TU Braunschweig.

## Requirements

The IDA Wireless Simulator is build upon [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) version 6. Additionally, the [INET framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org/) in version 4.4 is needed.

The library can be used on any operating system running OMNeT++ 6.x, including Linux and Windows.

For the purpose of automated experiment evaluation, Python 3 and the following packages are required:

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/index.html#installation-quick-start)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started)

## Installation

Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IDA-TUBS/IDAWirelessSimulator
```

Open *setup/profileTemplate* and enter the path to the INET package. Execute the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

 A small patch to the INET package is necessary. It can be applied by

```
./patchINET.sh
```



Then, the IDA Wireless Simulator can be added to your workspace within the OMNeT++ GUI, compiling and executing all relevant parts using the Eclipse IDE. Alternatively, everything can be build and executed from the command line. For further information on how to execute OMNeT++ code consult the latest [OMNeT++ user guide](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/UserGuide.pdf). All provided simulations can be executed using the *run.sh* scripts.

## Features

The IDA Wireless Simulator supports:

- Simulation of 802.11 wireless communication (cf. INET framework)
  - including MAC layer retransmissions for unicast communication
  - simulation of other applications
  - abstraction of channel interference using an average arbitration time
  - configurable bit error rates
  - Gilbert-Elliot model to simulate burst errors
- A standard-compliant RTPS middleware with BEC functionality
  - configurable heartbeat period
- The W2RP protocol [1, 2] to ensure reliable communication in unicast scenarios
  - writer configuration: periodic shaping
  - 
- The WiMEP [4] protocol enabling dedicated error protection for multicast applications
  - prioritization of readers 
  - multicast timeouts
- An extension of the W2RP protocol called E-W2RP [3] that allows for relaxing of samples' timing constraints for additional resilience in case of burst errors - integrated as part of WiMEP to also support multicast communication
- Exemplary
